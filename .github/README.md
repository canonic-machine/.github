# CANONIC

**CANONIC is a governance-first paradigm for human-driven AI systems.**

This organization hosts the reference implementation of the CANONIC stack: a minimal, reproducible architecture for building, observing, and publishing human–AI systems without sacrificing provenance, authorship, or accountability.

---

## Multi-Repository Artifacts

The CANONIC organization is composed of multiple repositories, each representing a distinct artifact in the governance-first stack. Direct links to each artifact:

- [canonic](https://github.com/canonic-machine/canonic) — root axioms and vocabulary
- [machine](https://github.com/canonic-machine/machine) — enforcement of governance constraints
- [os](https://github.com/canonic-machine/os) — minimal operating substrate
- [ledger](https://github.com/canonic-machine/ledger) — immutable evidence record
- [writing](https://github.com/canonic-machine/writing) — governed human–AI interaction
- [paper](https://github.com/canonic-machine/paper) — retrospective reconstruction and publication
- [agents](https://github.com/canonic-machine/agents) — subordinate AI executors (no authority)
- [stack](https://github.com/canonic-machine/stack) — observational composition across repositories
- [validators](https://github.com/canonic-machine/validators) — (private enforcement, if available)
- [patents](https://github.com/canonic-machine/patents) — disclosures and governance IP

Each repository is independently valid and composable. For details, see the README in each repo.

## What CANONIC is

CANONIC defines *law before execution*.

Rather than embedding rules inside tools or models, CANONIC separates:
- **Governance (CANON)** — immutable rules
- **Execution (AGENTS, tools)** — subordinate and observable
- **Evidence (LEDGER)** — immutable record
- **Reconstruction (WRITING / PAPER)** — retrospective interpretation

The result is AI-assisted work that is:
- human-authored
- auditable
- reproducible
- publication-safe
- IP-safe

---

## What CANONIC is not

CANONIC is **not**:
- an autonomous AI system
- an agent framework
- a workflow engine
- a prompt library
- a validator implementation

Execution is intentionally separated from governance.

---

## Public vs private

This organization publishes **governance, structure, and evidence**.

Certain enforcement mechanisms (e.g., validators) may exist privately and are intentionally excluded from public repositories. Public artifacts remain fully reproducible without them.

---

## Status

The CANONIC stack is active, minimal, and evolving.

Releases reflect *fixation points* where governed evolution collapses into reproducible state.

---

## Why this exists

Modern AI systems blur authorship, accountability, and provenance.

CANONIC exists to make those boundaries explicit — in code, in writing, and in publication.

---

## License

Each repository declares its own license.

Governance artifacts are intended to be read, reused, and scrutinized.

---

*Agents act. Humans decide. Ledgers remember. Papers reconstruct.*
