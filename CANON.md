# APPSTORE (/.github/)

inherits: /canonic/

## Compliance

**Level:** ENTERPRISE

This scope **MUST** maintain ENTERPRISE compliance:
- Triad (CANON, VOCAB, README)
- SPEC (APPSTORE.md)
- COVERAGE (internal closure)
- ROADMAP (external closure)

---

## Axioms

### 1. GitHub IS the App Store

GitHub **MUST** be the sole distribution platform.

GitHub provides:
- User management (100M+ developers)
- Billing (GitHub Marketplace)
- Discovery (search + topics)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Certification (badges)
- Scaling (Microsoft Azure)

---

### 2. Zero Infrastructure

APPSTORE **MUST NOT** require custom infrastructure.

GitHub builds everything; we build VALIDATORS only.

---

### 3. Validator Distribution

VALIDATORS **MUST** be distributed via GitHub Actions.

All CANONIC enforcement runs through GitHub Actions workflows.

---

### 4. Services Non-Governing

SERVICES **MUST NOT** modify CANON.

SERVICES produce artifacts. SERVICES are non-governing.

---

### 5. Apps Instantiation

APPS **MUST** inherit from SERVICES templates.

APPS are instantiated products with full CANONIC governance.

---

### 6. CANONBASE Aggregate

APPSTORE **IS** the CANONBASE.

COVERAGE.md **MUST** aggregate internal coverage across ALL scopes.
ROADMAP.md **MUST** aggregate external integration across ALL scopes.

APPSTORE provides the unified view of the entire multi-repo stack.

---

**This CANON defines validity for the APPSTORE scope.**
