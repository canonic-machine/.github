# CANONIC

**CANONIC is a governance-first paradigm for human-driven AI systems.**

This organization hosts the reference implementation of the CANONIC stack: a minimal, reproducible architecture for building, observing, and publishing human–AI systems without sacrificing provenance, authorship, or accountability.

## What CANONIC is

CANONIC defines *law before execution*.

Rather than embedding rules inside tools or models, CANONIC separates:
- **Governance (CANON)** — immutable rules
- **Execution (AGENTS, tools)** — subordinate and observable
- **Evidence (LEDGER)** — immutable record
- **Reconstruction (WRITING / PAPER)** — retrospective interpretation

The result is AI-assisted work that is:
- human-authored
- auditable
- reproducible
- publication-safe
- IP-safe

---

## Public vs Private

This organization publishes **governance, structure, and evidence**.

Certain repositories exist privately:
- **validators** — enforcement implementation
- **companies** — business entities (OncoNex)
- **patents** — invention disclosures (local-only, 53+ IDFs)

Public artifacts remain fully reproducible without them.

*Agents act. Humans decide. Ledgers remember. Papers reconstruct.*
