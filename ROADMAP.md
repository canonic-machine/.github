## Competitive Analysis

### The Fundamental Difference

| Feature | Traditional CI/CD | APPSTORE |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Build/Deploy | **Governance** |
| **Distribution** | Artifacts | **Governed Artifacts** |
| **Validation** | Tests | **Axiom Enforcement** |
| **Compliance** | External tools | **Built-in** |

### Unique Value Propositions

1. **Governance-First:** Validation is governance, not just testing
2. **Zero Infrastructure:** GitHub provides everything
3. **Template Inheritance:** APPS inherit from SERVICES
4. **Badge Certification:** Built-in compliance verification
5. **Economic Alignment:** TOKEN/COIN integration planned

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| GitHub dependency | Platform lock-in | Document exit strategy |
| Marketplace rejection | Revenue delay | Alternative billing |
| Validator performance | UX degradation | Caching, optimization |
| Adoption barriers | Low uptake | Documentation, tutorials |

---
