## Aggregate Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- [x] Root governance (canonic) ENTERPRISE
- [x] Language spec (language) ENTERPRISE
- [x] Validators suite (validators) ENTERPRISE
- [x] APPSTORE distribution (.github) ENTERPRISE
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows deployed
- [x] Pre-commit hooks operational (18 repos)
- [ ] All scopes have valid triad (10/19)

**Status:** 85% Complete

### Phase 3: Domain Governance

- [ ] paper → COMMUNITY (needs triad)
- [ ] mammochat → COMMUNITY (needs triad)
- [ ] companies → COMMUNITY (needs triad)
- [ ] publishing → COMMUNITY (needs triad)
- [ ] patents → COMMUNITY (needs triad)
- [ ] grants → COMMUNITY (needs triad)

## Conclusion

**CANONBASE External Closure:** In Progress

**Current State:**
- 4 ENTERPRISE scopes (canonic, .github, language, validators)
- 6 BUSINESS scopes (machine, os, ledger, stack, transcript, tutor)
- 9 INVALID scopes (missing triads)

**Next Milestones:**
1. Complete Phase 2 (upgrade 6 BUSINESS → ENTERPRISE)
2. Complete Phase 3 (add triads to 9 INVALID scopes)
3. Unblock paper and patents for publication
4. Launch GitHub Marketplace listing

**v1.0 Target:** All 19 scopes at ENTERPRISE compliance with external publications complete.
