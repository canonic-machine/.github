# Plan: GUIDE.md (Practical Guide)

**Scope:** .github/ (APPSTORE)
**Status:** Planned
**Created:** 2026-01-22

---

## Purpose

Create GUIDE.md as the practical, persuasive entry point to CANONIC. While LANGUAGE.md is theory and MANUAL.md explains theory, GUIDE.md is practical how-to that convinces readers CANONIC must supersede all other governance languages.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Persuasive** - Convince readers of CANONIC's superiority
2. **Practical** - How to adopt CANONIC in your project
3. **Advertises APPSTORE** - Showcases all products, services, VaaS
4. **References PAPER** - Points to academic backing

---

## Key Arguments

### Why CANONIC Supersedes Other Languages

1. **Self-Closing Design** - Only language that governs itself
2. **No External Dependencies** - Distribution is a primitive
3. **Economic Alignment** - TOKEN/COIN built in
4. **Domain Extensibility** - MED, LAW, FIN sublanguages
5. **Formal Rigor** - Academic-grade specification

### Comparison Points

- vs. Corporate governance: programmable, not procedural
- vs. Open source governance: enforceable, not advisory
- vs. Legal documents: executable, not interpretive
- vs. Configuration languages: complete, not partial
