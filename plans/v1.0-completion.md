### Upgrade Protocol

For each COMMUNITY scope:
1. Create `{SCOPE}.md` (SPEC) using language/templates/
2. Create `COVERAGE.md` using standard template
3. Create `ROADMAP.md` using standard template
4. Validate with VaaS
5. Commit to ledger

## Workstream 2: Paper Publication

### Current Reality

**Paper is ALREADY PUBLIC on GitHub** - just not PUBLISHED or ADVERTISED.
USPTO 1-year grace period is active from first public commit.

### Pipeline

```
Patents (FIRST) → arXiv → Publish Freeze → Advertise
```

### Tasks

1. [ ] **Patent Provisionals** (BLOCKER - see Workstream 3)
   - MUST complete before arXiv submission
   - Establishes priority date

2. [ ] **arXiv Submission**
   - Scope: paper/, publishing/
   - Action: Format manuscript for arXiv
   - Action: Submit to cs.SE or cs.AI
   - Deliverable: arXiv ID

3. [ ] **Publish Freeze**
   - Scope: paper/
   - Action: Mark CANON.md status as FROZEN
   - Action: Update ROADMAP.md

4. [ ] **Advertise**
   - Scope: .github/
   - Action: Public announcement with arXiv link

## Workstream 3: Patents

### Planned Filings

| ID | Title | Claims | Scope | Status |
|----|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| HADLEY-PROV-001 | Constitutional Governance | 42 | patents/ | Planned |
| HADLEY-PROV-002 | Platform Business | 12 | patents/ | Planned |

### Tasks

1. [ ] **Patent Drafts**
   - Scope: patents/
   - Action: Complete provisional applications
   - Deliverable: USPTO-ready documents

2. [ ] **USPTO Submission**
   - Scope: patents/, companies/foundation/
   - Action: File via USPTO EFS-Web
   - Deliverable: Application numbers

3. [ ] **Ledger Record**
   - Scope: ledger/
   - Action: Record filing dates and numbers
   - Action: Update patents/ROADMAP.md

---

## Workstream 4: GitHub Marketplace

### Tasks

   - Action: Package validators as GitHub Action
   - Action: Publish to Marketplace

---

## Workstream 5: Multi-Repo Stack

### Tasks

1. [ ] **Navigation Tables**
   - Scope: ALL 29 scopes
   - Action: Ensure README.md has Stack Navigation section
   - Validator: stack/analyze_workspace.py

2. [ ] **Transcript Automation**

   - Deliverable: Single command validates all 29 scopes

4. [ ] **Blockchain Anchoring**
   - Scope: transcript/, ledger/
   - Action: Implement anchor hash protocol
   - Status: Research (P2)

## Execution Order

### Critical Path

```
1. Patents (P0) → 2. arXiv → 3. Advertise → 4. Marketplace
                       ↓
                 ENTERPRISE Upgrade (parallel)
                       ↓
                 Stack Operations (parallel)
```

**Note:** Paper already public on GitHub. Patents establish priority before formal publication.

### Priority Matrix

| Task | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Patents | High | Medium | P0 |
| arXiv | High | Low | P1 |
| ENTERPRISE Upgrade | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| Advertise | Medium | Low | P2 |
| Marketplace | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| Stack Navigation | Low | Low | P2 |
| Transcript Automation | Low | High | P3 |

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Measure | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| ENTERPRISE | 29/29 scopes | 100% |
| Paper | arXiv published | 1 |
| Patents | USPTO filed | 2 |
| Marketplace | Listed | Yes |
| Stack | Navigation 100% | 29/29 |
