# CANONIC

**Own your AI.**

---

## The Problem

You use AI every day. Conversations disappear. Decisions are untraceable. When something goes wrong, you have no proof.

---

## The Solution

CANONIC gives you two things:

### TaaS — Transcript-as-a-Service

**Capture every AI conversation.**

- Hash-verified evidence
- Legally defensible proof
- "I had this idea first"
- "The AI said this"

### VaaS — Validator-as-a-Service

**Prove your AI is compliant.**

- FDA, HIPAA, SEC, GDPR
- Automated validation
- "Verified CANONIC" badge
- Pass audits, not anxiety
